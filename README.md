# Outfit quiz

The following code creates a website that mimics a Buzzfeed style personality quiz. 

The code utilizes html, python, and css. Flask allows the user to work with both html and python. 
Radio buttons were used to display pictures as answer choices for the quiz. 
Clicking on a picture initiates an action, directing the user to next html page.
Because clicking initiated the action, the POST method was delayed to the next route.

We, Naomi and Elena, learned how to work with flask and code in html.
We learned how to create clickable image with with radio buttons.
We somewhat learned how to branch and merge with GitHub
