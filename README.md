# Outfit Quiz

## Project Description
The following code creates a website that mimics a Buzzfeed style personality quiz. 

The code utilizes html, python, and css. Flask allows the user to work with both html and python. 
Radio buttons were used to display pictures as answer choices for the quiz. 
Clicking on a picture initiates an action, directing the user to next html page.
Because clicking initiated the action, the POST method was delayed to the next route.

## Concepts Learned
We, Naomi and Elena, learned how to work with flask and code in html.
We learned how to create clickable image with with radio buttons.
We somewhat learned how to branch and merge with GitHub

## Work Distribution
Elena formatted and filled the html pages index and quizes 1-4. She also created the styles page, which formatted the rest of the quiz. Elena created the skeletons of all of the routes as well.

Naomi designed the point system for the questions, coded the helper functions, and created the pages that tracks user data. She was also the troubleshooter of the pair.  

## Thoughts on the Project
This exercise was crash course in html. It illustrated how websites are formed today. We did not get to finish this project during hack110. Finishing touches were added in the following weeks. Overall, we are very happy with the results of our website.
